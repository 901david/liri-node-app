# liri-node-app

This will be a LIRI bot App created in Node.  It works in a similar manner to a 'SIRI' app but takes commands within the terminal.
Please see the below commands to determine the capabilities of the application.

Commands Accepted:

<<<<<<< HEAD
* node liri my-tweets <number of tweets to show>  - This command allows you to choose how many of the last tweets you want shown.

* node liri do-what-it-says  - This pulls prefilled text from a .txt file and uses that data to choose a movie, song, and to tweet out a random message, then show you that you actually did tweet it out.

Below you can see an example of the 'node liri do-what-it-says' command. It is reading a pre-filled text file to pull up a specific song, pull up a specific movie, and then tweet out a random tweet.  This gives you an idea of what this application is capable of.
